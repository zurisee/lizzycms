## Please Note

You should create an admin account ASAP.  

To do so, click on -> {{ link('?admin=first-user', 'add an admin-user', class:'lzy-button mybutton' ) }} and fill in your **e-mail address** and a **password**.

To do it manually, you need to create the file ``config/users.yaml`` (or rename config/#users.yaml) and 
define an admin user.

Note: passwords have to be entered in hashed form. To create a password hash, use the {{ link('?convert', 'password hash' ) }} tool.
