# ⚠️ List of fixed vulnerabilities

## Remote code execution vulnerability in the PHP component
> Fixed: 2018-10-13

The sample [PHP upload handler](server/php/index.php) before [v9.22.1](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/releases/tag/v9.22.1) allowed to upload all file types by default.  
This opens up a remote code execution vulnerability, unless the server is configured to not execute (PHP) files in the upload directory (`server/php/files`).  

The provided [.htaccess](server/php/files/.htaccess) file includes instructions for Apache to disable script execution, however [.htaccess support](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html) is disabled by default since Apache `v2.3.9` via [AllowOverride Directive](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#allowoverride).

**You are affected if you:**
1. Uploaded jQuery File Upload `version < 9.22.1` on a Webserver that executes all PHP scripts in the project directory, e.g. Apache with `mod_php` enabled.
2. Did not actively configure your Webserver to not execute files in the upload directory (`server/php/files`).
3. Are running Apache `v2.3.9+` with the default `AllowOverride` Directive set to `None` or another Webserver with no `.htaccess` support.

**How to fix it:**
1. Upgrade to the latest version of jQuery File Upload or limit file uploads to image file types - see [sample PHP code](server/php/index.php).
2. Configure your Webserver to not execute files in the upload directory, e.g. with the [sample Apache configuration](SECURITY.md#apache-config)

## Open redirect vulnerability in the GAE components
> Fixed: 2015-06-12

The sample Google App Engine upload handlers before v[9.10.1](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/releases/tag/9.10.1) accepted any URL as redirect target, making it possible to use the Webserver's domain for phishing attacks.

## Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Iframe Transport
> Fixed: 2012-08-09

The [redirect page](cors/result.html) for the [Iframe Transport](js/jquery.iframe-transport.js) before commit [4175032](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/commit/41750323a464e848856dc4c5c940663498beb74a) (*fixed in all tagged releases*) allowed executing arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the Webserver.
